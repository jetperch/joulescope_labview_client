# [JoulescopeÂ® LabVIEW client]

Welcome to the Joulescope LabVIEW client!  This client works with the 
[pyjoulescope_server](https://github.com/jetperch/pyjoulescope_server) to 
integrate the Joulescope JS110 to National Instrument's LabVIEW.  It has
been tested with LabVIEW 2015.

Thank you to Tverc2 for contributing this LabVIEW client to the 
Joulescope community!  See the 
[Joulescope forum](https://forum.joulescope.com/t/labview-support/94/52)
for more details.
